Hello motivators, this is a small project made by Christopher Ryan to clear the accountability spreadsheet and send emails

# NOTES
- (as of now) works for the Bravo Kraken platoon layout
- python does not have built in email list support (AKA no google group name)
- currently automatically checks for all emails in a platoon
    - assuming no one fucks up the spreadsheet layout
- full roster has 3 spaces between end of kraken emails and company staff, don't change this
